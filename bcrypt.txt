bcrypt.js is a popular js library used for hashing pass securly it uses a one way hashing algorithm to ensure paswords are stored securely making it 
almost impossibel to reverse the hash to the original pass

Encrytption:
users data and private key is personalised (developers key)


Encryption:=userdata+private key =random text
decryption:we have 2 parametres or inputs.. 1.randomised text 2.private key

decryption:randomised text +private key=userdata


hashing: user data and a random shuffle times value(salt) uses cpu consumption and resources
also called hash value


hashing userdata+saltvalue=hash
you cannot dehash original file
